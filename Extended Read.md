# Resource Allocation in 5G D2D Networks using Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the Python implementation of Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) 
based channel allocation for Device-to-Device (D2D) communication in 5G networks.

## 🧩 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
2. Run the simulation:

## 📊 Description
- `dqn_single_two_cell.py` – Main  Q-learning and DQN simulation file  
- `results/` – Contains simulation graphs (capacity, energy efficiency, etc.)
